# ESL Practice App
## Author: Joseph Cheatham
## Version(0.1)

### Description
This will be a Django web application that will allow ESL learners to practice their english skills in simulated text conversations.
Using LLM's and ChatGPT, the application will offer real time conversational feedback intended for intermediate to advanced learners.

Currently, there is a functioning web app that loads a temporary homepage. I am working on creating the homepage now. When the application
has the basic functionality I am targeting, the version will be updated to 1.0.
